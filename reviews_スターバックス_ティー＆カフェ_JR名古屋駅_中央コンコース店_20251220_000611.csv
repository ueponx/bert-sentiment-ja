■After eating at an all-you-can-eat yakiniku restaurant in front of the large building near Nagoya Station, I went to a Starbucks I'd been wanting to try.
※I walked from Endoji Shopping Street because I was driving.
Parking near Nagoya Station is expensive.😭
※I don't usually take the train, so I had someone guide me there.
■Nagoya Station, less than 5 minutes from the Golden Clock
■Starbucks just before the Shinkansen ticket counter.😁
■Eat-in available
■I think❓️This is the only one in Aichi Prefecture⚠️
■A specialty tea shop. The food menu is a little pricey, but apparently they do have a food menu (lol).
■Since this was my first time there and I didn't know much about it, 😂I told the staff to order something sweet and easy to drink from the menu (lol) and leave it all to them.🙋
■Strawberry Passion Tea
573 yen
■At first, I wondered if this was sweet, but...
After drinking about half of it, I realized...this might be my favorite (lol). There was even fruit pulp at the bottom, which was satisfying.
It was gone in no time by the time I walked back to Endoji Shopping Street (lol).
I was so satisfied! 🤗 I want to go again, maybe with someone knowledgeable about Starbucks and get their advice. 🥰
■I'll definitely be back when Amour starts! ‼️‼️‼️

I went around 11:00, but it was empty, so maybe it's a hidden gem?

By 12:30, there was a long line. 😵‍💫
I recommend planning your visit accordingly.

Even when it's busy, the staff are always quick to assist you. 🙏

Their tea menu is also popular, and I was asked if I wanted a cup or a pot, so I chose the pot.

They handed me a stopwatch and told me to drink it in one minute. I tried it once because I wanted to, but next time I'll probably just get a regular cup. 😅

There aren't many seats. There were people on their way to work or on business trips, and even some overseas visitors. I was surprised to see quite a few older people there.
It's rare to find a place to get tea inside a station, so...",ポジティブ,0.6220738291740417,0.10623667389154434,0.2716895639896393

It's a convenient location for a quick break before a departure or to meet up with someone.

I visited on a weekday evening. It was crowded as it had just opened, but recently I've been able to find a seat relatively easily.

This time I ordered a matcha tea latte.
It uses tea leaves from Starbucks' tea brand, TEAVANA, and has a pleasant balance of fragrant matcha flavor and the mellowness of steamed milk.
With just the right amount of sweetness and a refined bitterness, it's a cup that will put you in a relaxing mood.
The store is compact, with a focus on counters, but there are also seats with power outlets, making it convenient for short work sessions.
Despite being located inside a station, this is a rare tea-only Starbucks where you can enjoy a leisurely cup of black tea or matcha in a calm atmosphere.",ポジティブ,0.7786303162574768,0.04223305732011795,0.17913667857646942

It has the regular Starbucks tea menu, but I think this is the only store in Nagoya where you can enjoy the limited-edition menu at the moment.
They also offer customizations such as ice cream toppings that aren't available at regular stores.
It can be quite difficult to get a seat at times, so it would be nice if you could secure one smoothly.
It's a popular store, so that can't be helped.",ポジティブ,0.6738987565040588,0.07706058025360107,0.24904070794582367

The lines have finally died down recently, so I invited a friend over.

I'm not a big fan of teas with fruit in them, so I asked the staff member about it.

The tea latte I was planning to drink also contained jasmine, which I don't like.

The staff member was very kind.

The staff member told me that she doesn't like jasmine either, but she was able to drink the tea latte I was planning to drink.

I hesitated for a bit, but after listening to what the staff member had to say, I placed my order.

I asked for less ice, and they told me that I could get more tea for free.

Thank you for the wonderful service.

The pale pink and white color of this tea latte really gave it a Christmas feel.

The tea latte had a jasmine scent, but the flavor was very subtle.

I'm not a fan of jasmine, but it didn't bother me too much.

The mousse was smooth and had a nice texture.

The sweet and sour raspberry and mellow tea latte are a perfect match.

The sweet and sour raspberry adds a nice accent to this truly treat-filled tea latte.

You can also enjoy the texture of the raspberry pulp.

I used less ice, so it wasn't too cold and was easy to drink.

The sweet and sour raspberry and the mellow tea latte combined with the rich flavor of the black tea made for a truly delicious drink.

Thank you for the meal.
